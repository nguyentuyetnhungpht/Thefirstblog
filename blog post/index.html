                    <h3>Steve Jobs's  quote</h3>
                        <p class="quote-text">
                            Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
                        </p>
                   

                    <h3>Nick Hornby's quote</h3>
                        <p class="quote-text">
                            “People go on about places like Starbucks being unpersonal and all that, but what if that's what you want? I'd be lost if people like that got their way and there was nothing unpersonal in the world. I like to know that there are big places without windows where no one gives a shit. You need confidence to go into small places with regular customers... I'm happiest in the Virgin Megastore and Borders and Starbucks and Pizza Express, where no one gives a shit and no one knows who you are. My mum dad are always going on about how soulless those places are, and I'm like Der. That's the point.”
